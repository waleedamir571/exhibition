                            The purpose of “Storage” as it is contemplated under this Agreement is simply convenience;
                            the Customer’s Property can be quickly retrieved, transported, deployed, and displayed, and
                            then packed, transported, and stored until it is needed again, relieving the Customer of the
                            responsibilities of logistics and storage. EN will take reasonable steps to secure the
                            Property and shelter it from weather. However, Customer acknowledges and agrees that the
                            purpose of Storage is not special protection, maintenance, or safekeeping of Property.
                            Customer is solely responsible for withholding from Storage with EN, any property which
                            requires such special protection, maintenance, or safekeeping.

                            This Agreement has an initial “Term” of one “Calendar Year”. For the purposes of this
                            Agreement, “Calendar Year” shall be defined as the period beginning January 1 and ending
                            December 31 for the year referenced in the customer’s annual storage fee invoice from EN.
                            Storage contracts which begin during the referenced calendar year will be invoiced through
                            the balance of the calendar year. For example, Storage contracts beginning in the month of
                            January will be invoice for January 1 – December 31st, whereas storage contracts beginning
                            in February will be invoiced for February 1 – December 31st of the referenced year. Storage
                            fees will be charged for the full month regardless of the date during the month in which
                            storage is initiated. Fees as indicated in the invoice sent from EN are due and payable at
                            the beginning of each Term. This Agreement auto-renews until it is terminated in writing by
                            Customer or EN as provided in Paragraphs 8 and 9, respectively. Fees for auto-renewed Terms
                            will be invoiced around the renewal date, and are due upon receipt. Quarterly invoices are
                            available for an additional fee of $25 per invoice. Monthly invoices are available for an
                            additional fee of $35 per invoice. Increases in customers’ storage space are invoiced
                            through the end of the calendar year. Unpaid invoices incur a 10%-per-month late fee,
                            starting 60 days after the invoice date. If an invoice remains unpaid for 180 days, Customer
                            will be deemed to have Abandoned the Property as set forth in Paragraph 11(b).

                            subject the Property to extremes of temperature and humidity. Customer is solely responsible
                            for withholding from Storage with EN, any property which is sensitive to such extremes of
                            temperature or humidity.

                            Under certain circumstances, Property may be stored inside a building with Climate Control.
                            Customer acknowledges and agrees that “Climate Control” means simply that EN will make
                            reasonable efforts to avoid temperature extremes by keeping the building warmer than the
                            outside temperature in cold weather, and cooler than the outside temperature in hot weather,
                            through use of an HVAC system. As with any mechanical system, it is subject to malfunction,
                            failure, and loss of use during power outages. EN makes no representations or warranties

                            EN does not provide any type of insurance which would protect the Property from loss by
                            fire, theft, or any other type of casualty loss. Customer acknowledges and agrees that it is
                            Customer’s responsibility, at Customer’s sole expense, to secure such insurance to protect
                            itself and the Property against all perils of whatever nature, in an amount at least equal
                            to the total value of all Stored Property. Such insurance on the Property is strongly
                            recommended by EN. If Customer fails to obtain insurance, Customer automatically assumes all
                            risk of loss to Stored Property that would be covered by such insurance. Customer shall make
                            no claim whatsoever against EN’s insurance in the event of any loss. Customer expressly
                            agrees not to subrogate against EN in the event of loss or damage of any kind, from any
                            cause.
