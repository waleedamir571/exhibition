                                exhibit that Exhibit Network designed, fabricated, shipped, and installed. And she
                                cried. She cried because her new exhibit was so sophisticated and well-made, and, in her
                                words, “this was the easiest, simplest, and fastest installation” she had ever

                                We don’t think of it as an obsession; it’s just an exceedingly abundant enthusiasm for
                                the opportunity to meet potential buyers face-to-face. Exhibit Network knows the
                                importance of connecting and reconnecting with industry peers. This can happen at your
                                booth space and even more so at Happy Hour. That’s why we encourage you to let us take
                                care of the details for your exhibit so you can attend Happy Hour. We want you to be
                                fresh and relaxed when that “opportunity of a lifetime” presents itself in an unexpected
                                way.

                                our warehouse. We think this because visitors comment on our clean warehouse more than
                                anything else. A clean warehouse is to our clients’ advantage because our pull/prep time
                                is kept to a minimum, thereby reducing costs.
